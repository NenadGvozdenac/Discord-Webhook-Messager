# Discord-Webhook-Messager
This tool takes an input of a link for a discord webhook.
After that, the link is stored in a JSON file.
Then, it redirects you to a frame that lets you send messages via that webhook through a GUI application.

### Message
The message can consist of anything text related. It can have discord formatting etc.

### File uploading
You can also upload a file to send along with that message.
If you don't add a file, it won't be sent - easy.

### Information & Github
On the top Menu, there is an `Information` menu. 
Selecting it, you will be prompted to press one of the buttons.
`Github` sends you to this github page!
`About` sends you information of the application.

### Exit button
The exit button, as expected, exits the application.
